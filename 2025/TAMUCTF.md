## Simple Check

> I've given you a binary that allows you to read any file on the system. So, go ahead and read the flag. If you need to debug anything, I've put a helpful call logger on the remote.
> Hint 1: It's easier than you think. No binary payload or shellcoding required, I promise.
> Hint 2: Don't waste your time reversing async Rust. Just figure out what the call logger does to log calls.
