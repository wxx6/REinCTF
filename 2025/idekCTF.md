## Lazy VM

> I was too ~~lazy~~ busy to code a CTF challenge myself, so I hired a freelancer online for just $5 to take care of it. However, when I received the work, the quality was far below expectations. Deciding not to pay for the poor-quality challenge, I refused to settle the debt. Frustrated, the freelancer left the challenge running online, refusing to hand it over or shut it down.
> 
> All I know is that it’s a virtual machine challenge, and the flag.txt file is located in the same folder as the challenge. Beyond that, I have no idea how the challenge works
