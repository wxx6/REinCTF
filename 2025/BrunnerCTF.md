## Un-Pirateable Baking Game

> I made a new video game inspired by my favorite YouTuber! It's amazing! But you need a license key to play it, and I haven't set up the webshop yet...
Something with Steam isn't working quite right yet either, so I've removed it for now. But at least the DRM is Un-piratable, so you have to wait to try it 😄

## Timing is Everything

> The local Brunner baker is famous for his perfectly baked cakes - not too soft, not too crispy. But ever since his timer broke, he's been relying on an ancient encrypted recipe vault that only unlocks when the correct timing is entered.
> 
> Unfortunately, the baker forgot how the vault works. All he remembers is that "time is the key" and that it once revealed the secret ingredient for the ultimate cake.
> 
> Can you figure out how long his cakes need to bake... and recover the secret?

## CompSci Bakery

> My friend is studying computer science but has a student job at a bakery. He has an important class today on programming language theory and asked me to cover his shift.
> 
> "Just follow my recipe," he said. "It'll be fun!" he said.
> 
> Typical computer scientist: why bake a simple loaf when you can invent a Turing-complete croissant? Anyway, here is the recipe, let's get started.

## Bake to the Future

> Marty! Great Scott! I finally managed to reverse the encryption for the secret brunner recipe, but I forgot it in the future when I came back to tell you about it!
You HAVE to retrace my steps and go back to the future - it's life or death, Marty! Take the DeLorean and the encrypted recipe!

## RivalCakes

> The secret Brunner and Othello cults are waging their battles in the streets of Denmark.
> 
> One day, you see a member of the Othello cult drop their phone out of their pocket. You grab it, but it seems to be a burner phone. You find only two custom apps, but when opening one, it instantly deletes itself - maybe there is still some data left?
> 
> In the cake cults, preferences matter - so keep an eye out and mind what you say.
> 
> Your Othello rivals are planning a secret meetup, find out where and find the password to infiltrate them!
> 
> Flag format: The flag is formatted as brunner{<w3w_code>_<password>}, where <w3w_code> is the what3words code of the location, without leading slashes. Make sure your "3 word address language" is set to English.
